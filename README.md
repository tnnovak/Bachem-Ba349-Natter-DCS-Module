Get the last release:

Version 0.9 Beta [here](https://github.com/tnnovak/Bachem-Ba349-Natter-DCS-Module/releases/tag/v0.9)

There are actually 2 modules:

* The Natter airplane module proper
* The Launch Patform module

Unzip them both in your <b>Saved Games\DCS\Mods\Aircraft</b> folder

Then follow the instructions in the <b>Section "Quick Start" in the Handbook</b>

[Bachem Ba349 Natter Experimental DCS Module Handbook](https://github.com/tnnovak/Bachem-Ba349-Natter-DCS-Module/blob/main/Bachem%20Ba-349%20Natter%20Handbook.pdf)

For the takeoff sequence to work with the platform some mission LUA scripting is necessary to spawn the plafform.
The missions files already shipped in the <b>Missions\EN\QuickStart</b> folder already have the LUA scripts in them and hopefully they should work.

If not some manual setup may be necessary in the mission editor. The how to is in the Handbook also.
