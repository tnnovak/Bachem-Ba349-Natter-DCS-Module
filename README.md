# Bachem-Ba349-Natter-DCS-Module

Get the last release here:

Version 0.9 Beta [here]()

There are actually 2 modules:

The Natter airplane module proper
The Launch Patform module

Unzip them bot in your Saved Games\DCS\Mods\Aircraft folder

Then follow the instructions in the Section "Quick Start" in the Handbook:

[Handbook]()

For the takeoff sequence to work with the platform some mission LUA scripting is necessary to spawn the plafform.
The missions files already shipped in the Missions\EN\QuickStart folder already have the LUA scripts in them and hopefully they should work.

If not some manual setup may be necessary in the mission editor. The how to is in the Handbook also.
